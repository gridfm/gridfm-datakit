DEADLINE May 16th

## Data Gen
- [x] Generate data for grids ~150-300 buses
- [x] add branch and bus data necessary to compute line currents and check for violations (was not already implemented in the code ran by tamara) -> Alban
	- [ ] Generate new data with updated code -> Tamara

## Model
- [ ] Add scenario index to data objects
- [ ] Save predictions after inference in a format similar to pf_node.csv
- [x] Test model on generated data
	- [x] run all and flag the ones that were used during pre-training/ fine-tuning
	- [x] test finetuned model on ieee300
	- [ ] test finetuned model on case1354

## Post Processing on Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [x] Compute line current 
- [x] check against pandapower
- [ ] Implement functions to compute current and voltage violations -> Alban 
	- [x] first version 
	- [x] test against pandapower results
	- [ ] implement final version
