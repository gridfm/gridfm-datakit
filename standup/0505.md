DEADLINE May 16th

## Data Gen
- [x] Generate data for grids ~150-300 buses
- [ ] Generate branch and bus data necessary to compute line currents and check for violations (was not already implemented in the code ran by tamara) -> Alban
## PF Post Processing
- [x] Add all admittances (Yff Ytt Yft and Ytf) and line rate
	- [x] figure out how to compute that 
	- one value per line, but at the moment every line is duplicated 
	- In the future we should not have duplicated lines for both directions -> this would save gpu memory
	- decided to store network info once for all scenarios, 

## Model - Celia
- [ ] Add scenario index to data objects
- [ ] Save predictions after inference in a format similar to pf_node.csv
- [x] Test model on generated data
	- [x] run all and flag the ones that were used during pre-training/ fine-tuning
	- [ ] tested finetuned model on ieee300



## Post Processing on Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [x] Compute line current 
- [x] check against pandapower
- [ ] Implement functions to compute current and voltage violations -> Alban 
	- [x] first version 
	- [x] test against pandapower results
	- [ ] implement to work on inference results
