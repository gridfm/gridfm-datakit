DEADLINE May 16th

## Data Gen
- [x] Data for ieee300 with powergraph load profile -> easy data
- [x] Data for case 1354 with pglib load profile -> more complicated data

## Model
- [x] test finetuned model on ieee300 -> results are good 
- [x] test finetuned model on case1354 -> results of transformer conv seem bad 
- [x] Added scenario index to data object 
- [ ] run FT model on ieee300 and case1354

## Post Processing on Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [ ] implement final version of the function to compute line current
