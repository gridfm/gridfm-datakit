# 04/29

## Data Gen
- [x] Change current code to run PF after removing lines
	- [ ] Wrap this up this morning


f((P Q V theta), (network parameters)) =  power flows

## PF Post Processing
- [ ] Add line capacity
	- [x] Compute max current 
	- [ ] Add rateA to data
- [ ] Add information on which line was dropped to pf_node
- [ ] Add all admittance (Yff Ytt Yft and Ytf)
	- [ ] Need to figure out how to compute that 
		- [ ] No info in the pandapower code about 
		- [ ] Use matpower info instead?

## Post Processing of Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [ ] Check for voltage violation
- [ ] Check for current violation = Thermal limits = overloading
	- [ ] Struggling to compute it from bus-level results -> Help from Matteo?
- [ ] check for apparent power violation
	- [ ] Should be easier to compute from bus-level results

## Model
- [ ] Test model finetuned on PF on case 300
- [ ] Re-training on new data (since new data shows larger line loading)
## "Theory"

- [x] Figure out what to do when AC-PF doesn't converge (we can't label the data in that case)
	- [x] Solution for now: discard them
> 	"in _steady-state power flow_, "no convergence" usually means that the solver can't find a physically realistic equilibrium given the conditions."
    
> 	"it doesn't necessarily mean that the system immediately "blows up" in real life â€” but it very likely indicates that the post-contingency steady-state is **unreachable** without corrective actions (e.g., load shedding, generator rescheduling, remedial actions)."
	    
> 	"In **real-world dynamics**, if no action is taken fast enough, the system could **become unstable** (voltage collapse, angle instability, cascading failures)"

- [x] Figure out whether to use apparent power or current to check for overloading
	- [x] current 

- [x] Compare to DC
	- How to define line overloading with DC since no reactive power?
	- fine with current

- [ ] Compare to AC with less iterations
	- Will that really speed up things?
