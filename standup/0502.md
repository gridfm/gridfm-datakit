## Data Gen
- [x]Generate data for grids ~150-300 buses
	- [ ] Tamara generated data (now on cos bucket) for:
		- ![[Pasted image 20250430160649.png]]
	- [ ] case200_activ: no overloading, even when dropping 5 lines
		- ![[Pasted image 20250430124554.png]]


## PF Post Processing
- [ ] Add all admittances (Yff Ytt Yft and Ytf) and line rate
	- [x] figure out how to compute that 
	- [ ] one value per line, but at the moment every line is duplicated 

## Post Processing of Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [x] Compute line current 
- [x] check against pandapower
- [ ] Check for voltage violation
- [ ] Check for current violation = Thermal limits = overloading

## Model
- [ ] Test model on generated data -> Celia
	- [ ] run all and flag the ones that were used during pre-training/ fine-tuning
- [ ] Re-training on new data (since new data shows larger line loading
