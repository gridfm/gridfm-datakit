# 06/04
DEADLINE May 16th

## To Discuss:
- Results on ieee300 with finetuned model on PF
- Results of my model on ieee24
- Visualization (aggregated stats over entire simulation)

## Data Gen
- [ ] Data for ieee118 -> Tamara
- [ ] generate all n-2 contingencies for ieee24 as backup plan 
- [ ] Add DC data to pf_node for comparison (!!!!!) 2/4
- [ ] Add DC time for run time comparison (!!!!!) 3/4

## Model
- [ ] finetune model on ieee300 -> Celia
- [ ] finetune model on ieee118 -> Celia
<!-- - [ ] Train Alban's model on ieee118 -> Alban -->
Decide on monday which one to pick 

## Post Processing on Model Outputs and Violation Detection
- [ ] check voltage mag violations (!!) 1/4
- [ ] compute loading with DC data !!! (4/4)


10% misclassification
10 times speed up
how many n-1 
how many n-2

check 100% peak 
check why good tpr with so many wrongly predicted loading (my model)

-> are they interested in many time steps or are they fine with 
-> uncertainty quantification
-> how to share data (format)


check with n-1 only
check with n-2
