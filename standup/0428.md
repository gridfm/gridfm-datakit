# 04/28

## Meeting Agenda
- show contingency analysis features from pandapower -> show notebook
	- https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contingency.html
	- Checks voltage magnitude and line overload
- Quick presentation of the code to change 
- Quick presentation of the pipeline 
## "Theory"

- [ ] Figure out what to do when AC-PF doesn't converge (we can't label the data in that case)
	- [ ] Solution for now: discard them
> 	"in _steady-state power flow_, "no convergence" usually means that the solver can't find a physically realistic equilibrium given the conditions."
    
> 	"it doesn't necessarily mean that the system immediately "blows up" in real life â€” but it very likely indicates that the post-contingency steady-state is **unreachable** without corrective actions (e.g., load shedding, generator rescheduling, remedial actions)."
	    
> 	"In **real-world dynamics**, if no action is taken fast enough, the system could **become unstable** (voltage collapse, angle instability, cascading failures)"

- [ ] Figure out whether to use apparent power or current to check for overloading

- [ ] Compare to DC
	- How to define line overloading with DC since no reactive power?

- [ ] Compare to AC with less iterations
	- Will that really speed up things?
