network:
  name: "case24_ieee_rts" # Name of the power grid network (without extension)
  source: "pglib" # Data source for the grid; options: pglib, file
  # WARNING: the following parameter is only used if source is "file"
  network_dir: "scripts/grids" # if using source "file", this is the directory containing the network file (relative to the project root)

load:
  generator: "powergraph" # Name of the load generator; options: agg_load_profile, powergraph
  agg_profile: "default" # Name of the aggregated load profile
  scenarios: 10 # Number of different load scenarios to generate
  # WARNING: the following parameters are only used if generator is "agg_load_profile"
  # if using generator "powergraph", these parameters are ignored
  sigma: 0.2 # max local noise
  change_reactive_power: true # If true, changes reactive power of loads. If False, keeps the ones from the case file
  global_range: 0.4 # Range of the global scaling factor. used to set the lower bound of the scaling factor
  max_scaling_factor: 4.0 # Max upper bound of the global scaling factor
  step_size: 0.1 # Step size when finding the upper bound of the global scaling factor
  start_scaling_factor: 1.0 # Initial value of the global scaling factor

topology_perturbation:
  type: "none" # Type of topology generator; options: n_minus_k, random, none
  # WARNING: the following parameters are only used if type is not "none"
  k: 1 # Maximum number of components to drop in each perturbation
  n_topology_variants: 2 # Number of unique perturbed topologies per scenario
  elements: [branch, gen] # elements to perturb. options: branch, gen

generation_perturbation:
  type: "none" # Type of generation perturbation; options: cost_permutation, cost_perturbation, none
  # WARNING: the following parameter is only used if type is "cost_permutation"
  sigma: 1.0 # Size of range used for sampling scaling factor

admittance_perturbation:
  type: "none" # Type of admittance perturbation; options: random_perturbation, none
  # WARNING: the following parameter is only used if type is "random_perturbation"
  sigma: 0.2 # Size of range used for sampling scaling factor

settings:
  num_processes: 5 # Number of parallel processes to use
  data_dir: "./testdelll" # Directory to save generated data relative to the project root
  large_chunk_size: 1000 # Number of load scenarios processed before saving
  overwrite: true # If true, overwrites existing files, if false, appends to files
  mode: "pf" # Mode of the script; options: pf, opf. pf: power flow data where one or more operating limits – the inequality constraints defined in OPF, e.g., voltage magnitude or branch limits – may be violated. opf:  generates datapoints for training OPF solvers, with cost-optimal dispatches that satisfy all operating limits (OPF-feasible)
  include_dc_res: true # If true, also stores the results of dc power flow or dc optimal power flow
  enable_solver_logs: true # If true, write OPF/PF logs to {data_dir}/solver_log; PF fast and DCPF fast do not log.
  pf_fast: true # Whether to use fast PF solver by default (compute_ac_pf from powermodels.jl); if false, uses Ipopt-based PF. Some networks (typically large ones e.g. case10000_goc) do not work with pf_fast: true. pf_fast is faster and more accurate than the Ipopt-based PF.
  dcpf_fast: true # Whether to use fast DCPF solver by default (compute_dc_pf from PowerModels.jl)
  max_iter: 200 # Max iterations for Ipopt-based solvers
  seed: null # Seed for random number generation. If null, a random seed is generated (RECOMMENDED). To get the same data across runs, set the seed and note that ALL OTHER PARAMETERS IN THE CONFIG FILE MUST BE THE SAME.
