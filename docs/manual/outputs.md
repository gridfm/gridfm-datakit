# Outputs

This page provides a detailed description of the output files generated by the data generation process. All files are saved in the specified data directory.

## Output Files

### Log Files

#### `tqdm.log`
Progress bar log showing the execution progress of the data generation process.

#### `error.log`
Log of any errors raised during data generation.

#### `args.log`
Copy of the configuration file used for the data generation run.

### Network Data Files

#### `pf_node.csv`
Contains data related to the nodes (buses) in the network:
- **scenario**: Index of the scenario (This is not the load scenario index, but a unique identifier of the pf case. There can be many scenarios per load scenario in case of topology perturbation)
- **bus**: Index of the bus
- **Pd**: Active power demand at the bus
- **Qd**: Reactive power demand at the bus
- **Pg**: Active power generation at the bus
- **Qg**: Reactive power generation at the bus
- **Vm**: Voltage magnitude at the bus
- **Va**: Voltage angle at the bus
- **PQ**: Indicates if the bus is a PQ bus
- **PV**: Indicates if the bus is a PV bus
- **REF**: Indicates if the bus is a reference bus


#### `pf_edge.csv`
Branch admittance matrix for each power flow case (accounting for perturbations, i.e. a dropped branch won't appear in the adjacency list).

#### `branch_idx_removed.csv`
List of the indices of the branches (lines and transformers) that got removed when perturbing the topologies.

### Network Parameters

#### `edge_params.csv`
Branch admittance matrix and branch rate limits for the unperturbed topology. Contains the following columns:
- **from_bus**: Index of the source bus
- **to_bus**: Index of the destination bus
- **Yff_r**: Real part of the self-admittance at the source bus
- **Yff_i**: Imaginary part of the self-admittance at the source bus
- **Yft_r**: Real part of the mutual admittance from source to destination bus
- **Yft_i**: Imaginary part of the mutual admittance from source to destination bus
- **Ytf_r**: Real part of the mutual admittance from destination to source bus
- **Ytf_i**: Imaginary part of the mutual admittance from destination to source bus
- **Ytt_r**: Real part of the self-admittance at the destination bus
- **Ytt_i**: Imaginary part of the self-admittance at the destination bus
- **rate_a**: Rate limit of the branch

#### `bus_params.csv`
Parameters for the buses, such as voltage limits and the base voltage. Contains the following columns:
- **bus**: Index of the bus
- **type**: Type of the bus (e.g., PQ, PV, REF)
- **vmin**: Minimum voltage limit at the bus
- **vmax**: Maximum voltage limit at the bus
- **baseKV**: Base voltage level at the bus

### Load Scenario Files

#### `scenario_{args.load.generator}.csv`
Load element-level load profile obtained after using the load scenario generator. The file name depends on the generator type specified in the config (e.g., `scenarios_agg_load_profile.csv` or `scenarios_powergraph.csv`).

#### `scenario_{args.load.generator}.html`
Plots of the element-level load profile. The file name depends on the generator type specified in the config (e.g., `scenarios_agg_load_profile.html` or `scenarios_powergraph.html`).

#### `scenario_{args.load.generator}.log`
If generator is "agg_load_profile", this file stores the upper and lower bounds for the global scaling factor. The file name depends on the generator type specified in the config (e.g., `scenarios_agg_load_profile.log`).

### Statistics Files

#### `stats.csv`
Statistics about the generated data, including metrics such as:
- Number of generators
- Number of lines and transformers
- Number of overloads
- Maximum loading values
- Other network performance metrics

#### `stats_plot.html`
Plots visualizing the statistics about the generated data.
