# Outputs

This page provides a detailed description of the output files generated by the data generation process.

## Output Files

### `node_data.csv`

Contains data related to the nodes (buses) in the network, such as voltage levels and power injections. This file is generated by the `save_node_edge_data` function and includes the following columns:

- **scenario**: Index of the scenario.
- **bus**: Index of the bus.
- **Pd**: Active power demand at the bus.
- **Qd**: Reactive power demand at the bus.
- **Pg**: Active power generation at the bus.
- **Qg**: Reactive power generation at the bus.
- **Vm**: Voltage magnitude at the bus.
- **Va**: Voltage angle at the bus.
- **PQ**: Indicates if the bus is a PQ bus.
- **PV**: Indicates if the bus is a PV bus.
- **REF**: Indicates if the bus is a reference bus.
- **Vm_dc**: DC voltage magnitude at the bus (only for contingency mode).
- **Va_dc**: DC voltage angle at the bus (only for contingency mode).

### `edge_data.csv`

Contains data related to the edges (lines and transformers) in the network, such as impedance and power flow. This file is also generated by the `save_node_edge_data` function and includes columns for edge indices and their associated data.

### `branch_indices.csv`

Lists the indices of the branches (lines and transformers) in the network. This file is generated by the `save_branch_idx_removed` function and includes the following columns:

- **scenario**: Index of the scenario.
- **branch_idx**: Index of the removed branch.

### `edge_params.csv`

Contains parameters for the edges, such as resistance and reactance. This file is generated by the `save_edge_params` function and includes the following columns:

- **from_bus**: Index of the source bus.
- **to_bus**: Index of the destination bus.
- **Yff_r**: Real part of the self-admittance at the source bus.
- **Yff_i**: Imaginary part of the self-admittance at the source bus.
- **Yft_r**: Real part of the mutual admittance from source to destination bus.
- **Yft_i**: Imaginary part of the mutual admittance from source to destination bus.
- **Ytf_r**: Real part of the mutual admittance from destination to source bus.
- **Ytf_i**: Imaginary part of the mutual admittance from destination to source bus.
- **Ytt_r**: Real part of the self-admittance at the destination bus.
- **Ytt_i**: Imaginary part of the self-admittance at the destination bus.
- **rate_a**: Rate limit of the branch.

### `bus_params.csv`

Contains parameters for the buses, such as voltage limits and base values. This file is generated by the `save_bus_params` function and includes the following columns:

- **bus**: Index of the bus.
- **type**: Type of the bus (e.g., PQ, PV, REF).
- **vmin**: Minimum voltage limit at the bus.
- **vmax**: Maximum voltage limit at the bus.
- **baseKV**: Base voltage level at the bus.

### `scenarios.csv`

Contains the generated load scenarios. This file is generated by the load scenario generation process and includes data for each scenario.

### `scenarios_plot.html`

An HTML file with plots of the load scenarios. This file is generated to visualize the load scenarios.

### `scenarios_log`

A log file containing information about the generation of load scenarios. This file records the progress and any issues encountered during the load scenario generation.

### `stats.csv`

Contains statistical data about the network, such as the number of generators, lines, transformers, overloads, and maximum loading. This file is generated by the `Stats` class and includes various network metrics.

### `stats_plot.html`

An HTML file with plots of the network statistics. This file is generated to visualize the network statistics.
